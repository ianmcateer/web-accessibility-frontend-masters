## WHat is Accessibility

little bit vague 
when people tlak about web accessibility talking about making those apps usable by people with disabilities

similar fields:
- web performance 
- intrnationalization
- ui design: making app easy to use, easy to understand 

making app accessibile on slow connections

intenationalization - process of getitng app translated, great and important but its not what covering

but accessibility is all about people with disabilities

web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the web, and that they can contribute to the web

Statistics:
- 26% of people have some type of disability
- 2 in 5 by time 65 years of age

### Types of disabilities

- mobiility and physcial
- cognitive and neurogical
- visual
- hearing 

the web by itself is alreadt accessible 

issue when adding lots of javascript and css

reach a larger issue, reach a larger audience, impactful, makes you a specialist

more legal issue that dont have an accessible website 

### Amazing ways people use the web

keyboard only- folks who struggle to use a mouse, power users trying to make keyboard shortcuts faster way to navigate
is eeything on website accessible keyboard only?
thingks can only click on but cant tab on?


head wand - accessing keyboard with a wand on their head, how many keystorkes take?

mouth sticks

single switch- one button 

screen reader- non visual way interacting with the web - will read out in audio format the content you are accessing 

no api tell is screen reader, but cleevr ways speak directly to assistive technologies 

## Curb Cut Effect

an investment in one group can cascade out and up and be a investment in the broader well being of a nation 

make it alot more enjoyable for everyone 

these things that get put up for people with disabilities but ends up benefitting everybody 

3 phase approach when thinking accessibility

- design stage 
- building stage
- accessiiblity testing once built

web accessibilty helps SEO , helps your site vitals 

image alternative text: seo users see this as change to keyword stuff for keywords they want to rank for, accessibility engineers know that that text is only for sight readers

## Accesibilty Standards


WCAG specifies three different compliacne levels:
- A (lowest)
- AA (mid range)
- AAA (highest)

specs are big and wordy, hard ot understand

WEBAIM - cool group not the official spec but a nice user friendly checklsit 

webaim checklist is good 


what is aria?
HTML provides fair amount of things to make things accessible but there are limitations 

ARIA is w3soec (same group who do html and js)- they are accesisiblity focused helpers eg an img would have src and alt but if needet to add label you can use that, tleling the role of something
