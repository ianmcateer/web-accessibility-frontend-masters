## Alternative Text and Captions

by default when a screen reader encounters an image, ifit cant find alt text it will read alout the files name to the user

gets tricky for websites that allow users to generate images adding alt will cause screen reader to read whatever put in alt instead of the file name

if dont know what the picture is 1. put in soemthing generic 2. put in empty alt text

images that are decroate - if put alt="" will force screen reader to skip over the image 

a note on SEO - search engines use alt text as well, for years SEO shops have been stuffing the keywords you want to rank for into alt text wherever possible

google devalued ranking of alt text over the years

is a d vi with background image different from an img tag?? screen reader will ignore css background images
